about_desc: `
    ModWorkshop is a platform that hosts mods for games, providing the necessary tools to share and create mods, tools, and ideas. 
    
    In 2013, we began as LastBullet, the number one platform for PAYDAY modding.
    As development continued, we rebranded as ModWorkshop. We wanted to expand our range of possibility into other games, rather than exclusively to the PAYDAY franchise. 
    Today, we host mods for multiple games such as PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY: The Heist, Noita, Enter the Gungeon, and more!
    Together, we've brought modders, fans, and newcomers to the modding field, to communicate with each other and discuss together.
    
    We think modding should be open source, not closed source. There is no point to modding if mods are not available for others to tinker with. 
    As such, we have a rule requiring mods to be open source to some degree.
    
    We absolutely love modding, and if you want to host any mod for any game, feel free to do so! 
    If the '[Other Games](/g/other)' section is not enough, contact us and we can discuss about making a section dedicated for that game!
