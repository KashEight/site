# ModWorkshop Frontend

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://nuxt.com).

## Setup
There isn't too much special things to do for the front-end.
We use Yarn mainly so just get NodeJS + Yarn, copy .env.example to .env and fill it.

Make sure to install the dependencies

Even easier if you use Docker :)

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#deployment).
