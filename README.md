# ModWorkshop Backend

This repository contains the source code for the backend side of ModWorkshop
The backend uses the Laravel framework.

## Developing
Developing the backend, alongside the frontend, requires the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Visit https://github.com/ModWorkshop/mws-docker-setup for more information.
While it is possible to install all dependencies by yourself, it is not that recommended as Docker can install all instantly.
